# BletchleyMaker
![Program Demo](./image.gif)

A personal project aimed at RAFAC (RAF Air Cadet) code-breaking exercises. The purpose of this tool is to encode sentences and create decode grids for the Air Cadet Bletchley Park cipher. This automates the process of making codes for Air Cadet activities.

## Features Available
- Encoding plaintext sentences into Bletchley Park ciphertext
- Generating a randomised decryption table (6x6 A-Z 0-9)
- Decoding input ciphertext
- Saving, opening and printing grids (Printing ONLY works in A4)

## Tool Use
Upon downloading one of the two .exe files, you should be able to run them and use the tool.

### Basic guide:
- Generate: Generates a new random 6x6 grid including letters A-Z and 0-9
- Execute: Takes string from 'Text to Convert' and applies the reverse of the decode rule to encode
- Decode: If checked, will decode string from 'Text to Convert' with the decode rule as entered
- Use Output: Will copy text from output into 'Text to Convert'
